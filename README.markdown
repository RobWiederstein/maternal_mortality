## Introduction

["Protecting our expecting and new mothers isn’t a partisan issue." --Senator Mitch McConnell](reference/2018-12-26_ky_today_mconnell_preventing_maternal_mortality.pdf)

"Seven hundred mothers die every year, and over 50,000 others experience dangerous complications that could have killed them -- making the U.S. the most dangerous place in the developed world to give birth." [NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

## Definitions

"Pregnancy-related deaths" are defined by the CDC as any time a woman dies while pregnant or within one year of the end of a pregnancy from any cause related to the pregnancy or its management.  Accidental deaths are not included.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)


## Major Federal Enactments

### Preventing Maternal Deaths Act

This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program under which HHS may make grants to states for the purpose of: (1) reviewing pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths (maternal deaths); (2) establishing and sustaining a maternal mortality review committee to review relevant information; (3) ensuring that the state department of health develops a plan for ongoing health care provider education in order to improve the quality of maternal care, disseminate findings, and implement recommendations; (4) disseminating a case abstraction form to aid information collection for HHS review and preserve its uniformity; and (5) providing for the public disclosure of information included in state reports.

The bill defines "pregnancy-associated death" as the death of a woman while pregnant or during the one-year period following the date of the end of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death. It defines "pregnancy-related death" as the death of a woman while pregnant or during the one-year period following the date of the end of pregnancy, irrespective of the pregnancy's duration, from any cause related to, or aggravated by, the pregnancy or its management, excluding any accidental or incidental cause.

States are to develop procedures for mandatory reporting to their departments of health by health facilities and professionals concerning maternal deaths and for voluntary reporting of such deaths by family members.  States shall investigate each case and prepare a case summary for each case, to be reviewed by the committee and included in applicable reports.  The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to direct HHS to take specified steps to eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes.

### Improving Access to Maternity Care Act

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to identify maternity care health professional target areas, which are areas within health professional shortage areas that have a shortage of maternity care health professionals, for purposes of assigning maternity care health professionals to those areas.  HRSA must collect and publish data comparing the availability of and need for maternity care health services in health professional shortage areas and areas within those areas.

- American woman 3x more likely to die from childbirth than a Canadian woman.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- 6x more likely to die than a Scandinavian woman.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- Kazakhstan and Libya have better rates than U.S.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- national mortality rate more than doubled between 1987 and 2012 (20.7 deaths / 100,000)[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- U.S. is one of 13 countries where the rate of maternal mortality is worse in 2018 than twenty-five years prior.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- African-American women are 243% more likely to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes, regardless of their socioeconomic or educational levels.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

- CDC estimates that 60% of maternal deaths could be prevented.

## Maternal Mortality Review Committee

Half of states have this type of committee. [NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)  

Georgia lowered the risk of preterm birth by 33 to 47%.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)  Medical practices in 46 states have adopted the Centering Pregnancy model.[NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf).  

Committee verifies whether maternal death was related to pregnancy. Vital records rely on coding and timing of death, which doesn't reveal the full picture. [NCSL, Maternity Care in Crisis (2019)](reference/2019-01-11_ncsl_maternity_care_in_crisis.pdf)

President Trump signed the bipartisan Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2017 on December 22 of 2018.  The act authorizes programs to promote safe motherhood and to support states in establishing or improving mortality review committees.

Examples of Mortality Review Committees include the following:


## Areas to Legislate

Kentucky has a maternal mortality review committee.

The group is not run by government, but KMA.

Kentucky, unlike many other states, doesn’t require hospitals to report or work to prevent “adverse events” that can reflect drastic lapses in patient safety.

## Kentucky

According to an [article](https://www.usatoday.com/list/news/investigations/maternal-mortality-by-state/7b6a2a48-0b79-40c2-a44d-8111879a8336/) in the USA today, Kentucky is ranked 13th out of 46 states with 22.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. There were 55,449 children born in Kentucky.  Additionally, Kentucky's "harm rate" was 32 out of 47.  

Kentucky’s maternal death review board is run by a private medical society and doesn’t issue public reports. The public can get copies of minutes from the group’s meetings, which used to be published in the medical association’s journal. The minutes describe each case, without names or locations but with detailed descriptions of what happened medically. The minutes don’t include recommendations or lessons learned from those cases.  The only internet reference to such a committee was the image below:

![Kentucky Medical Ass'n Maternal Mortality Study Committee](img/kma_maternal_mortality_study_committee.png)

In 2018, Kentucky made changes to its statutes regarding maternal fatalities.  KRS 211.184 permitted the Department of Health to establish a "state child and maternal fatality review team."  A "maternal fatality"  was defined as the "death of a woman within (1) year of child birth."  [KRS 211.684(1)(c)](enactments/2018-07-14_krs_211.684.pdf).  If a state team was created, they were to develop protocol for local teams, provide training and technical assistance to local teams, review and approve local protocols, receive and analyze data on child and maternal fatalities, evaluate prevention and intervention strategies, recommend changes to improve outcomes.  [KRS 211.684(3)(a-f)](enactments/2018-07-14_krs_211.684.pdf). The Department of Health was to provide an annual report on child and maternal fatalities by November 1st of each year.  [KRS 211.684(4)](enactments/2018-07-14_krs_211.684.pdf).  [KRS 211.686](enactments/2018-07-14_krs_211.686.pdf) provided for local counties to establish under the authority of the coroner a child maternal fatality committee.
